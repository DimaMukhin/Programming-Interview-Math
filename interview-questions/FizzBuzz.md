# FizzBuzz

### Not entirely math, but algorithmic

## What?
The basic principle behind FizzBuzz is the children's game where two children count from 1 to 100 (or more). Child A says 1, Child B says 2, Child A says 3, etc. But instead of just counting, whenever the number is divisible by 3 they say "Fizz", and if it's divisible by 5 they say "Buzz".

So it's 1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,etc.

Caveat: When it's divisible by 3 and 5 they say FizzBuzz.

Example: 1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7,8,Fizz,Buzz,11,Fizz,13,14,**FizzBuzz**,16,etc

## Why?

The reason to use this test is to see what process the programmer takes to solve this. It's great when it's done live in front of the interviewer, because generally people would start to loop the numbers, and then start with Fizz, then do Buzz, and then realize "hold on, what about divisible by both 3 and 5", and then fix their code.

It shows the cognitive process they go through - which is to a large extent much more important than mere regurgitation of knowledge of language/technology.
